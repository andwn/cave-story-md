[日本語はこちら](README-ja.md)

This is a rewrite/port of the popular freeware game Cave Story for Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.
It should work on any console or emulator. The main story is "finished", only little things and bugfixes remain.

## Download
"Stable" releases can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/andwn/cave-story-md/releases) tab.

The latest builds that have not gone through as much testing are available [here](https://tenshi.skychase.zone/cs/).

## Default Controls
If you have a 6 button controller:

- `C` - Jump, confirm
- `B` - Shoot
- `A` - Fast forward through scripted events
- `Y`, `Z` - Switch weapon
- `X` - Map system
- `Start` - Pause / Item Menu

For 3 button, `A` cycles through weapons. The rest is the same.

### Cheats
- Stage Select: up, down, left, right, A + Start. Like Sonic.
- Infinite health/ammo: up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, A + Start.

You can still get crushed, drown and fall out of bounds.

Note that you can't load or save the game while cheating (including the counter).

## Compilation
1. Dependencies: `build-essential libpng-dev` and a GCC cross compiler for "m68k-elf" such as [Marsdev](http://github.com/andwn/marsdev).
2. Clone & `make`
  - For translations: `make translate`

## License
- Source Code: MIT
- Art and Story: Copyright Studio Pixel

tl;dr - Use the code however you like, but the assets and game itself can not be sold or used in commercial works.
