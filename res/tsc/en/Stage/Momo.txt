Oh, thank goodness...<NOD<CLRI'm Momorin Sakamoto.<NOD
Sue's mother.<NOD
I used to take my
chances working at the
Doctor's side.<NOD
But once he found the
seeds, he had no more
use for me.<NOD
So he had me tossed off
the edge of the island.<NOD<CLRChivalry is dead,
let me tell you.<NOD<CLRBut that's neither here
nor there.<NOD<CLRRight now I'm working
on building a rocket,<NOD
one that will get you
to the Doctor's throne.<NOD

the parts yet, though.<NOD<CLO
