### Notice

- If any commits contain changes to source code, please **provide a compiled ROM** of your changes. This is to verify you have actually tested building (and possibly even playing!) with the changes.

- For assets it might be fine not to do that, but with graphics especially there have been problems in the past so make sure you have read and understood [CONTRIBUTING.md]

- Documentation only pull requests are not accepted. No automated slop either please.
