**First off**
I don't make translations, but can port already existing ones for the freeware PC game.
So link such a translation here.

**Text and encoding**
What symbols are needed outside the basic ASCII 32-127 range to support this language?
If it's something more complex like CJK or RTL, please recommend a font or two.

**Addendum**
If you want advice on how to translate the game, this repository is not the right place to ask.
There should be some people on the cavestory.org forums familiar with the process.
